Every great remote lab needs clear instructions. Students need to understand what they're doing, why they're doing it, and how to interpret their results. The **Markdown-it Module** transforms simple text into rich, interactive documentation that makes your labs easier to follow and more engaging.

## What is the Markdown-it Module?

The Markdown-it Module brings powerful documentation capabilities to your Edrys-Lite labs. Write your lab instructions, explanations, and educational content in simple Markdown, and the module renders it beautifully with support for mathematical formulas, diagrams, embedded videos, and more.

It's like having a textbook, whiteboard, and presentation slides all in one - right next to your interactive lab components.

## Why Documentation Matters

Great labs aren't just about tools - they need context. The Markdown-it Module helps you provide:

- **Clear instructions** - Guide students through exercises step by step
- **Theoretical background** - Explain the concepts behind the experiments
- **Visual aids** - Include diagrams, flowcharts, and illustrations
- **Mathematical notation** - Display formulas and equations properly
- **Multimedia content** - Embed videos, images, and interactive elements
- **Structured learning** - Organize content with headings, lists, and sections

## Beyond Basic Markdown

While standard Markdown is already powerful, the Markdown-it Module goes further with specialized support for educational content:

### Mathematical Formulas

Need to explain an algorithm or physical law? Write formulas using standard mathematical notation with KaTeX support. From simple inline equations to complex multi-line derivations, mathematical content renders beautifully and clearly.

### Diagrams and Visualizations

Create professional diagrams without leaving your text editor:

- **UML diagrams** with PlantUML - Perfect for software architecture and sequence diagrams
- **Graph visualizations** with DOT - Ideal for data structures, networks, and flowcharts  
- **ASCII-art diagrams** with ditaa - Turn simple text drawings into polished diagrams

These tools let you illustrate concepts visually without needing separate diagramming software or image editing tools.

### Multimedia Integration

Embed YouTube videos, images, or even interactive HTML content directly in your documentation. Students get a complete learning experience without leaving the lab environment.

## Flexible and Role-Aware

Different users might need different information. The Markdown-it Module lets you customize content for different roles:

- **Students** see instructions, tasks, and learning objectives
- **Teachers** get additional notes, answer keys, or assessment criteria
- **Stations** receive setup instructions or configuration details

Everyone gets exactly the information they need, presented clearly and consistently.

## Perfect for Course Design

The Markdown-it Module shines when building complete learning experiences:

- **Lab manuals** - Comprehensive guides that combine theory and practice
- **Quick references** - Concise documentation students can check while working
- **Assignment sheets** - Clear task descriptions with grading criteria
- **Learning modules** - Self-paced content with explanations and exercises
- **Troubleshooting guides** - Help students solve common problems independently

## Getting Started

Add rich documentation to your Edrys-Lite lab by including this URL:

```
https://edrys-labs.github.io/module-markdown-it/index.html
```

Then write your content in Markdown. The module handles all the rendering, diagram generation, and formula display automatically. What you write is what your students see - beautifully formatted and ready to learn from.

## A Complete Learning Environment

When combined with the [Editor Module](/blog/posts/009_module-editor/), [Terminal Module](/blog/posts/010_module-pyxtermjs/), and [Streaming Module](/blog/posts/011_module-streaming/), the Markdown-it Module provides the educational context that makes remote labs truly effective.

Students don't just use tools - they understand what they're doing and why it matters.

The Markdown-it Module is open source and ready to transform your lab instructions into engaging learning materials.
