We are delighted to share that our research project participated in eLearning Africa from 29 to 31 May 2024. During this 3-day conference, we hosted an engaging demonstration and workshop on the topic of "Creating Sustainable and Extendable Open Educational Resources (OER) as an Interactive Classroom." A key component of this session was the edrys-Lite, which has been further developed within the CrossLab framework. The event provided an excellent opportunity to showcase our latest advancements and collaborate with participants to shape the future of interactive educational resources. We are grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate how edrys-Lite contributes to the creation of sustainable and extendable OER.

Instead of using servers, Learning Management Systems (LMS), etc. the edrys-Lite approach requires only a browser. By creating a browser-based peer-to-peer net, we are able to share the access to the hardware/experiment/lab that is attached to the teacher's laptop. And since labs are based on separate modules, that can be easily combined and configured, such lab-configurations can be shared and reused like OER (open educational resources).

At the moment we offer 12 labs that you can find here (more to come):
