# Presentation

## Edrys-Lite – Shareable Peer-to-Peer Remote Labs – Using Only Browser Technologies

__Date:__ Thursday, 10/Apr/2025 \
__Time:__ 9:36am - 9:54am \
__Location:__ V213 Classroom

This paper presents a novel approach to creating shareable, peer-to-peer remote labs using solely browser technologies, eliminating the need for dedicated servers. Modern web browsers, equipped with APIs for hardware interaction and real-time peer-to-peer capabilities, enable educators to construct labs that operate entirely through decentralized connectivity. Utilizing the Edrys-Lite application, a lightweight reimplementation of the original Edrys classroom system, remote labs can be easily configured using human-readable formats like JSON or YAML and shared through simple URLs. This serverless model leverages WebRTC and WebTorrent for user connectivity, while Yjs CRDTs ensure real-time synchronization and conflict resolution. The result is a scalable, cost-effective solution for running open educational resources as remote labs, providing accessible, reusable, and modifiable labs stored openly on GitHub. Testing has demonstrated successful application across various fields, from Arduino programming to large-scale chemical simulations. This approach empowers educators to deploy lab environments swiftly, enhancing accessibility and reducing setup complexity.
