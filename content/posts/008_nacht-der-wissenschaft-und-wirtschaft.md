The 9th Night of Science and Economy in Freiberg was a truly wonderful opportunity to present the results of the CrossLab project to the general public. At the opening of the ROBOLAB in the heart of Freiberg, the CrossLab team at TUBAF were delighted to have the chance to inspire young and old for computer science and give visitors the chance to get to know some remote computer science laboratories on site.

The ROBOLAB in Burgstra√üe is a wonderful place for the people of Freiberg and visitors to meet and exchange experiences with members of the university. Some of the CrossLab remote labs have found a permanent home in the ROBOLAB premises, where they provide a fascinating insight into the incredible diversity of student education.

The campaign was a great success, with lots of interest and fantastic responses from visitors, as well as people from science and politics.
