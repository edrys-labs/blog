Participants in the "Software Development for Embedded Systems" lecture recently undertook an ambitious project: creating five remote labs as open educational resources using edrys-Lite. This integrated practical course challenged students not only to tackle the technical aspects but also to craft comprehensive learning experiences. Each lab solution includes detailed descriptions of learning objectives, introductory quizzes, and task descriptions to ensure a thorough understanding.

The lab topics showcase a range of embedded systems applications, from a CAN sniffer using STM32 to a microROS application on a Raspberry Pi Micro, and fundamental motor control principles with an AtMega 328p. These innovative solutions are set to be refined and will become available to students in the upcoming semester, providing valuable hands-on learning opportunities in a remote setting.

These efforts highlight the ingenuity and dedication of our students in enhancing remote learning resources, paving the way for a more interactive and accessible educational experience.
