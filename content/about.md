Welcome to the edrys-Lite blog! This is where we share our journey of creating a lighter, more accessible approach to classroom technology.

## What is edrys-Lite?

edrys-Lite is an open-source educational platform that brings simplicity back to digital classrooms. Born from the belief that educational technology should empower rather than overwhelm, we've created a streamlined system that requires:

- No installation
- No server setup
- No user accounts
- No database configuration

Instead, edrys-Lite offers a browser-based collaborative learning environment that just works, letting educators focus on teaching rather than troubleshooting.

## Our Philosophy

We believe educational technology should be:

1. **Accessible to everyone** - regardless of technical skill or infrastructure
2. **Genuinely helpful** - enhancing teaching and learning, not complicating it
3. **Respectful of privacy** - minimizing data collection and storage
4. **Adaptable to different contexts** - from formal classrooms to informal learning spaces

## Technical Approach

edrys-Lite embraces modern web technologies to create a lightweight yet powerful platform:

- Built with modern JavaScript and web standards
- Uses peer-to-peer connections to eliminate server dependencies
- Employs executable notebooks for interactive learning experiences
- Integrates seamlessly with LiaScript for rich educational content

## Join Our Journey

edrys-Lite is more than software—it's a community effort to improve how we teach and learn in digital spaces. Whether you're an educator looking for simpler tools, a student seeking engaging learning experiences, or a developer interested in educational technology, we welcome your participation.

Follow our development, try our demos, and contribute your ideas. Together, we're creating educational technology that truly serves education.
